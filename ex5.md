## Question 1
It is more appropriate to use .timeit when you want to test a quick run and want to see the general time of how long it would take, and also it is used when you want to see the time for a number of iterations. It is also better for when you want to reduce the impact for measurement noise. The .repeat is used when you want to see a list of times and is more apprpriate to check the variability between the times, this way you can get a better understanding of how different runs can vary from other runs in terms of time. This is also better for when you want to account for external factors like system fluctuations.
## Question 2
For the .timeit, it is generally better because it returns us the general time of how fast the code would run, whereas min and max would be more difficult to understand, since it would be only one run that you are basing it off of. The average would make much more sense because it represents the typical execution time. For .repeat, it would be better to use the min and max statistic because it gives us the understanding of how fast and how slow the code can run. This would give you a better understanding of the performance of the code. Average would also be nice, except theres no point to it, as .repeat is a way to better understand how fast or slow the code runs, not a way to see the typical performance run.
