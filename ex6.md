## Question 1
Advantages of arrays are that they are easy to access and are in general simpler to use than linked lists. They have an O(1) time complexity for retrievals and replacements if the index is known. Some disadvantages are that they have fixed size arrays and it can either limit the size of the array, or waste a lot of memory space (contiguous). They also have an O(n) time complexity for adding or removing elements and dynamic sized arrays require copying, which results in O(n).

Advantages of linked lists are that they take up less memory and space and dynamically changing the size is much easier and does not require the whole list to be copied. They also have an O(1) time complexity for adding and removing elements, unlike arrays. The disadvantages of linked lists, however, are that they are more complex to access and even if the index is known, traversing the list, causes an O(n) time complexity.
## Question 2
An easy way would to just switch the value with the new one. But to implement the deletion and insertion method; one can first check which end of the array the index value is closest to. If it is closest to the left end, take out the value at the index and shift all the elements on the left of the index to the right, and vice versa if it was closest to the right side of the array. Then, to insert the value back, reshift the elements that were shifted back to its original place and insert the newer value in. This implements the deletion and insertion method by minimizing the iteration times.
## Question 3
Both insertion sort and merge sort on a double linked list are possible. This is because traversing through a list is much easier and quicker now as well since there are nodes pointing to the previous node. Insertion would just have to traverse backwards and replace the index value that would need to be switched, by switching the node pointers. Merge sort would just create another 2 doubly linked list, and since it is doubly linked, it is again quicker and reduces the time complexity. It also would just need to adjust the linking between each of the nodes when comparing, making the merging aspect much easier, and would not always require a new list to be created. (Like inplace sorting)
## Question 4
Insertion sort would still have a time complexity of O(n^2) and merge sort should have a time complexity of O(n logn). It would differ from an actual array because of the actual code, as it would require much more work to  traverse through the list and make sure each node is linekd properly to the next sorted node. Arrays would be much simpler to implement these sorts on, except they would take up much more space compared to linked lists, since for linked lists, there is no need to allocate a lot more space.
